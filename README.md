After loading the dataset in Power BI, I took the followin applications:

## Steps Taken in Power BI Desktop Application:

# Theme and Color Palette:

* First of all, I started with a plane background theme where I used one header at the top with different icons on the top of it which I used for Page Navigation also.
* Then, I chose the colors which are brown, white, orange, blue.


# Dataset Applications in Power BI:

* I applied some DAX measures inside the dataset where I used functions like DISTINCTCOUNT, COUNTROWS, AVERAGE, etc to find the count of it.


## Key Insights from the Report:

* All the services provided by Churn Dataset is good for retention of customers and those services could be more promoted by the company to retain the customers and reduce the chances of customers being churned.
* More the number of senior citizens, less the chance of being churned.
* Internet Service DSL should be more promoted to lessen the chances of customer being churned.
* When payment method is Credit Card used by customer, chances of customer being churned is minimal.
* When tenure of the Plan purchased by customer is high, chances of customer being churned is low.



## Conclusion:
Overall, it was a nice dataset to work around with and I loved to visualize the dataset and come with the insights from it.
